All content and examples are pulled from [JavaScript for impatient programmers (ES2021 edition)](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/) online book as a personal exercise on my own reading of the book, only a few changes were made to keep the code working.

All credits for this project go to its author, Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.
